# Zara-TrackYourOrder
"TrackYourOrder" is a responsive web application for tracking customer’s delivery.

## Usage
Open the project folder and run the "index.html" file!

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JS, SASS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Mapbox and Google Places Autocomplete


## Additional Notes
1- the app is responsive.  
2- tracking process can be done by entering Tracking Number (any will do).  
3- tracking timeline is visual (it should be updated based on the delivery vehicle location via adding "achieved" class to the related "li" element.)  
4- delivery vehicle marker on the map can be switched between car and bike.  
5- the map shows the origin and destination of shipping as well as the delivery vehicle location.  
6- by clicking on the origin and destination points and delivery vehicle on the map, the details will be displayed.  
7- the Google Places Autocomplete has been added, yet I don not have access to the API, so it throws an error.  
8- after changing the delivery address, the new address is displayed on the screen, yet, the destination marker on the map is not updated (the address needs to be translated into latitude and longitude).
